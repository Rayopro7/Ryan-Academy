        <h1>Module 1: Introduction to the Web</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the foundational module of Web Development! Before writing a single line of HTML, it's crucial to understand the underlying infrastructure and protocols that make the World Wide Web possible. This module demystifies the journey of a webpage from a server to your screen.</p>

        <h2>Lesson 1: How the Web Works - A Deeper Dive</h2>

        <h3>1. The Client-Server Architecture</h3>
        <p>At its core, the web operates on a <strong>Client-Server Architecture</strong>. This is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client:</strong> Typically, this is your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) running on your device (computer, tablet, phone). Its primary role is to initiate requests for resources and display the data returned by the server. Clients are the consumers of services.</li>
            <li><strong>Server:</strong> This is a powerful computer (or cluster of computers) running specialized software (like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS) designed to listen for and respond to requests from clients. Servers host the website's files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos, databases) and execute backend logic. They are the providers of services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Interaction Flow:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>You type a URL (e.g., `https://www.ryanacademy.fake`) into your browser or click a link.</li>
            <li>The browser constructs an HTTP request asking the server for the specific resource (usually the HTML page first).</li>
            <li>This request travels across the internet infrastructure to the correct server (using IP addresses and DNS, explained next).</li>
            <li>The server processes the request. This might involve retrieving static files or running backend code to generate dynamic content.</li>
            <li>The server packages the requested resource(s) into an HTTP response.</li>
            <li>The response travels back across the internet to your browser.</li>
            <li>The browser receives the response, parses the content (HTML, CSS, JS), and renders the visual webpage on your screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This fundamental request-response cycle underpins almost all interactions on the web.</p>

        <h3>2. HTTP and HTTPS: The Web's Communication Protocols</h3>
        <p>Communication between clients and servers requires a standardized language, a protocol. The primary protocol for the web is the <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTTP:</strong> An application-layer protocol designed for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It defines methods (like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. It's stateless, meaning each request is independent, and the server doesn't retain information about previous requests from the same client by default (mechanisms like cookies are used to manage state).</li>
            <li><strong>HTTPS (HTTP Secure):</strong> Standard HTTP is unencrypted, meaning data is sent as plain text, making it vulnerable to interception. HTTPS addresses this by layering HTTP on top of the <strong>TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer)</strong> protocol. TLS/SSL encrypts the communication channel between the client and server, ensuring:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Protects against eavesdropping.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensures data hasn't been tampered with during transit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Often verifies the identity of the server (via SSL certificates), ensuring you're talking to the legitimate website.</li>
                </ul>
                Using HTTPS is now standard practice and essential for any site handling sensitive information or wanting user trust. Browsers actively flag non-HTTPS sites as "Not Secure".
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. IP Addresses and DNS: The Internet's Addressing System</h3>
        <p>Every device connected to the internet needs a unique address to be identified and located, much like every house needs a postal address. This is the role of the <strong>Internet Protocol (IP) Address</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> A numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. Examples include IPv4 (`172.217.160.142`) and the newer, longer IPv6 format (`2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`). Servers hosting websites have IP addresses.</li>
            <li><strong>DNS (Domain Name System):</strong> While computers use IP addresses, humans find names like `ryanacademy.fake` much easier to remember. DNS acts as a distributed, hierarchical directory service that translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. When you enter a domain name:
                <ol>
                    <li>Your browser/OS queries a DNS Resolver (often provided by your ISP or a public service like Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS).</li>
                    <li>The resolver may have the IP cached; if not, it queries authoritative DNS servers across the internet, starting from the root servers, down through the Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers (`.com`, `.org`, `.fake`), to the domain's specific nameservers.</li>
                    <li>Eventually, the authoritative nameserver for `ryanacademy.fake` provides the corresponding IP address back to the resolver, which returns it to your browser.</li>
                    <li>Your browser can now initiate the HTTP(S) request directly to the server's IP address.</li>
                </ol>
                DNS is a critical, often invisible, part of the internet infrastructure.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Browsers and Rendering: Bringing Code to Life</h3>
        <p>The web browser is the user's window to the web. Its core function is to fetch resources from servers and render them visually and interactively. This involves several key steps and components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Parsing:</strong> The browser reads the HTML code and builds a tree-like structure called the <strong>DOM (Document Object Model)</strong>. This represents the page's structure in memory. Similarly, it parses CSS to create the <strong>CSSOM (CSS Object Model)</strong>, representing the styles.</li>
            <li><strong>Render Tree Construction:</strong> The DOM and CSSOM are combined to form the Render Tree. This tree only includes elements that will be visually displayed (e.g., elements styled with `display: none;` are omitted).</li>
            <li><strong>Layout (or Reflow):</strong> The browser calculates the exact position and size of each element in the Render Tree based on the CSS rules (box model, positioning, flexbox, grid, etc.) and the viewport dimensions.</li>
            <li><strong>Painting (or Rasterizing):</strong> The browser draws the pixels for each element onto the screen, considering styles like color, background, borders, and text.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript Execution:</strong> The browser's JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome/Edge, SpiderMonkey in Firefox) parses and executes JavaScript code. JS can interact with the DOM and CSSOM to dynamically change the page's structure, style, or content after the initial render, often triggering further reflows and repaints.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Understanding this rendering pipeline helps in optimizing website performance.</p>

        <h3>5. Developer Tools: Your Essential Toolkit</h3>
        <p>Mastering the browser's built-in Developer Tools (DevTools) is non-negotiable for any web developer. They provide invaluable insights into how a webpage is built, styled, and behaving.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Elements Panel (Inspector):</strong> Live view of the DOM tree. Select elements to see their HTML structure, applied CSS rules (including inherited and overridden styles), computed styles, box model dimensions, event listeners, and more. You can edit HTML and CSS live in the browser for rapid prototyping and debugging.</li>
            <li><strong>Console Panel:</strong> Displays log messages, warnings, and errors from the browser and JavaScript code. It's also an interactive JavaScript environment (REPL) where you can execute commands to inspect or manipulate the page state.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Panel:</strong> Records all network requests made by the page (HTML, CSS, JS, images, API calls). Analyze request/response headers, timings (latency, download time), status codes, and payload sizes. Crucial for diagnosing loading issues and performance bottlenecks.</li>
            <li><strong>Sources Panel:</strong> View the source code of loaded files (HTML, CSS, JS). Set breakpoints in JavaScript code to pause execution, step through code line-by-line, inspect variable values, and debug complex logic.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Panel (Storage):</strong> Inspect and manage various browser storage mechanisms like Cookies, Local Storage, Session Storage, IndexedDB, and Cache Storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Panel:</strong> Record and analyze runtime performance, identify bottlenecks in rendering or script execution, and visualize the browser's activity over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Lighthouse Panel (in Chrome):</strong> Run automated audits for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regularly using DevTools to explore websites (even ones you didn't build) is an excellent way to learn and troubleshoot.</p>
